Alt-Send a message to a loved one... in Morse Code!
===============================================

I wanted to have a way to make my Arduino take in a message in English, translate it into Morse and then display it with it's built-in LED's (can be any LED though).
It's a cool little project that you can play with. It's licensed under the GPLv3. Get in touch if you have any questions.
